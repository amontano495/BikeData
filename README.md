# BikeData
Jupyter Notebook machine learning project utilizing Sklearn, Matplotlib, Pandas and Numpy.

This is a basic analysis of a dataset posted on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset .  There was also another goal of developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict the total number of bike riders using the app given certain conditions about the day. A writeup on the analysis can be found on my blog at https://adammontano.wordpress.com/
